Collection of scripts for automating the installation of packages 
and making a few other system tweaks on Windows systems.

**NOTE:** This repository is experimental, as I do not use Windows as my daily
driver. Use at your own risk.

## Installation

[PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/).
